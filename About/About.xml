--- Original Description ---
Adds gold and silver ingots that you can store sell or melt,

Guys, dont forget to rate the mod

This is also mean for large scale trading, is recommended to modify the silver and stuff amounts on the orbital trader so u can trade properly
-100% Vanilla

1 Ingot = x100 Gold / Silver, trade value is affected by trading skill

There is a chance of loss 1-2 units if you melt the ingot again
due to the ingots are not 100% pure

Comments and ideas are very appreciated
